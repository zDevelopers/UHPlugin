#
# This module tweaks the creatures spawn in the worlds (any creature; any biome).
# You can increase, decrease or even remove completely an entity to/from a specific or all biomes.
#
# This mainly act on **chunk generation** (it is also effective for natural spawns to refill the world
# with new creatures, but way less). It works by patching the Minecraft Biomes registry to update the
# spawning rules. So, you should generate (using WorldBorder and its fill command, for example) the world with this
# plugin running and this module enabled, for best results.
#
# To enable ths module at startup, add it into the main `config.yml` file, like so:
#
#  modules:
#   "worldgen.creatures": true
#
#
#
# Each spawning rule have these properties. Except if specified, unset properties will be left as-is.
#
# - The entity, obviously.
#   The list is available here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
#
# - The weight of the entity in the biome.
#   The higher the weight is, the likelier the mob is to be selected when the server looks for a mob to spawn (in all
#   cases). If set to 0, the entity will not spawn at all from natural spawning.
#
# - The minimal pack size.
#   While generating the chunks (and only while generating the chunks), the server will spawn entities in groups; this
#   is the minimal size of such groups.
#
# - The maximal pack size.
#   Same, but it's the max.
#
# - The biomes where this rule is active.
#   If you precise nothing at all about the biomes (only the previous properties), the rule will be updated for
#   all biomes already having a rule for the given entity (so the entity will not spawn in *new* biomes).
#
#   If you want the rule to be applied to *all* biomes, add `biomes: ALL`. This will tell Minecraft to spawn the
#   entity in all biomes, including these where the entity does not spawn in vanilla. This includes the Nether and the
#   End. In this example, Mushroom Cows will rarely spawn in all biomes (not only Mushroom Islands).
#
#   spawn_rules:
#     - entity: MUSHROOM_COW
#       weight: 1
#       biomes: ALL
#
#   If you want to apply this rule to some specific biomes (leaving rules for this entity in other biomes untouched,
#   list the biomes in a `biomes` key, like in the following example. This example will tell Minecraft to spawn
#   blazes with a very, very high weight in deserts & savannas (including plateaux).
#
#   spawn_rules:
#     - entity: BLAZE
#       weight: 250   # This would basically mean “blazes everywhere” (in the biomes below, at least)
#       biomes:
#         - DESERT
#         - SAVANNA
#         - SAVANNA_PLATEAU
#
#   The biomes' list is available here: https://gist.github.com/AmauryCarrade/667ada6cbba41b3c3475217247ab9715
#
#
#
# The default spawn rules below are a bit heavier for passive useful creature in typical survival games. Feel free to
# alter them to your preferences, of course.
#
# This module alters the spawning rules when enabled **for the whole server lifetime**. Even if disabled, the rules will
# still be there. If the server is rebooted without this module, the rules will be reset to Minecraft default.
#
# If you remove all spawn rules, the behavior will be vanilla.
#
# In case of conflicts (i.e. multiples rules for the same entity and the same biome), the last rule in the list wins.
#
# As a finale note, please remember that entities will still spawn according to their environmental rules. As example,
# cows spawn on grass. This imply that some rules may not work as you intended. As example, if you configure rabbits
# to spawn in the Nether, the rule will be saved into the Minecraft server, but you'll never see any rabbit in there,
# because there is no grass or sand in the Nether.
