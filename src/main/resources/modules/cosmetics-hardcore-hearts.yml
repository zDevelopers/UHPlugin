# If a player die, with old Minecraft versions, his client will display an hardcore Game Over screen,
# without a « Respawn » button. But the player CAN respawn, by clicking « Leave server » and then,
# on the confirmation screen, « Respawn ».
# This option can automatically respawn the player after its death.
# Recent versions of Minecraft do have a « Spectate » button in the Game Over screen, but you can still
# enable the auto-respawn for them.
