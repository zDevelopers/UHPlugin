# The cage type. Can be:
# - team_color_transparent (stained glass using the team color, or white without color/for solo);
# - team_color_solid (the same with stained hardened clay);
# - custom (a custom block, configure the one to use after).
type: TEAM_COLOR_TRANSPARENT

# If you selected “custom” before, write here the block you want to use. It can be any valid Material.
# You can use safely any falling block here, they will never fall.
custom-block:

# If true, the cages will be built completely, including the ceiling. Else, they will be open to the sky.
build-ceiling: false

# If true, the walls will be built using the block above. Else, using barrier blocks.
visible-walls: true

# The internal square radius of the cage.
# With 0, you'll have a cage with one block to walk.
# With 1, you'll have a 3×3 cage.
# With 2, a 5×5 cage. Etc.
radius: 2

# The internal height of the cages, i.e. the height of the space available to the players inside the cage.
# It is kinda useless to set a too high height here, as players won't be able to fly.
height: 3
