# This module allows you to schedule commands at any moment during the game. They will be executed by the console
# automatically.
# For each game phase, you'll be able to configure a list of commands to run, with a delay for each of them. The
# commands will be executed when the phase is reached, after the given delay. As example, a command configured into
# the `in-game` list with a 3-minutes delay will be executed three minutes after the game's start.
# The delay's formats are "mm" (minutes), "mm:ss" or "hh:mm:ss".
# Empty commands are ignored.


# Commands executed from the server startup.
wait:
  - exec: ""
    delay: "00:12:00"


# Commands executed from the moment the game is launched (when the /uh start is first executed, or the corresponding
# GUI button). Beware that this phase can be cancelled, e.g. if the game cannot be started. If so, all non-executed
# commands will not be executed, but some (especially with a zero delay) may have been executed and could be executed
# twice.
starting:
  - exec: ""

# Commands executed from the moment the game starts for real, when players falls from their spawn point into the world.
in-game:
  - exec: ""
    delay: "00:48:00"


# Commands executed from the game's end. Beware that this phase can be cancelled, e.g. if someone is resurrected. If so,
# all non-executed commands will not be executed, but some ay have been executed and could be executed twice.
