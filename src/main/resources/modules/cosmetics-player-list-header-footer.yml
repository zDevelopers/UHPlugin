# You can here fill the header and footer of the player's list (opened with TAB by default)
# with custom strings. You can include chat color codes (with either § or &) and special
# placeholders that will be replaced by special values.
#
# You can use `\n` to split the text over multiple lines.
#
# By default, the following placeholders are available:
#
# {title} -> title of the game
# {playersText} -> the string « x players », where x is the number of players alive
# {playersCount} -> the number of alive players
# {teamsText} -> the string « x teams », where x is the number of teams alive
# {teamsCount} -> the number of alive teams
#
# If the episodes module is loaded, the following are also available:
#
# {episodeText} -> the string « Episode x », where x is the current episode number
# {episodeNumber} -> The current episode's number.
#
# Any module can add their own placeholders (including you owns). Use /uh list-hf-placeholders
# to get a list of all available placeholders for your modules.
