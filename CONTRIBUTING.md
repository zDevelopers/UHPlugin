## How to contribute

### Bugs

1. Check if the bug exists in the [latest development build](http://jenkins.carrade.eu/job/UltraHardcoreReloaded/).
1. Check if you're using **Bukkit 1.7.9 or later** (older versions are not supported).
1. Please choose **a descriptive title.**  
   *Bad: « Error »*  
   *Good: « Crash when the plugin starts: “Invalid plugin.yml” »*
1. Write the **steps to reproduce** the bug.
1. **Join the version *and* the build number** (displayed in the `/uh about` command) to your issue.  
   *If there isn't any line for the build number, you're not using the latest version. In this case, provide only the version number.*

2. Open **one issue per suggestion**, not one issue with multiple ideas.
